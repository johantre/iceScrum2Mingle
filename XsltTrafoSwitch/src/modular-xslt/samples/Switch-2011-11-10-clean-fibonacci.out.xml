"#212"^"Database module"^"h2. Narrative


As a  I can  to As a (prepress) manager on a tight budget I only want to pay for features I
actually use, i.e. Database tool, access to the database variables and
possibility to gather content for a SwitchClient dropdown list straight from a
database, in order to get the most out of my investment.

h2. Notes


•The Database connect element
•The database variables 
•And access to ODBC data sources when defining dropdown list as metadata fields
on Submit and Checkpoints 
Should be licensed separately from Switch. Meaning that only when I use a valid
key, this flow element and its new category title (Database) become available
in the elements pane, the database group becomes available in the variables
panel (i.e. define single/ multi line or condition with variables dialog) and
“Define values from ODBC data source” becomes available as data value for
dropdown list.

The key can either be a permanent or trial key. Both keys have the same result,
however a trial key is time bombed so when it expires, functionality cannot be
used anymore. Same thing when you deactivate a key.

h2. Acceptance Criteria


This feature was already implemented in Switch 10 update 1. Only thing that
needs to be taken care of is that the Database connect elements appears in it’s
own category instead of being part of the metadata category.

Every module has its specific key. Each key only includes one feature that matches the module.

Database module, SwitchClient module, SwitchClient SDK, scripting module, metadata module and configurator module functionality is unlocked with an individual key.

As a an operator I can have an installer that does not refer to old switch flavors anymore but leaves old versions intact to end up with a clean installation of Switch 11 that does not affect previous versionsh2. Notes


Create a new installer for this new product.

h2. Acceptance Criteria


The installer is re-branded. (except for the artwork everything refers to 'Switch)
Old versions are *not* longer removed as it used to be (i.e. on win uninstall, on Mac clean up if we can find it)
So a user that has an old LightSwitch 10 and FullSwitch 10 actually ends up with 3 versions (LightSwitch 10, FullSwitch 10 and Switch 11)

"#211"^"Scripting module"^"h2. Narrative


As a  I can  to As a (prepress) manager on a tight budget I only want to pay for features I
actually use, i.e. Scripting, in order to get the most out of my investment.

h2. Notes


The script element and property editor “Define script expression” should be
licensed separately from Switch. Meaning that only when I use a valid key, this
flow element and its category title (Scripting) become available in the
elements pane and the script expression property editor becomes available in
the properties pane.
The key can either be a permanent or trial key. Both keys have the same result,
however a trial key is time bombed so when it expires, functionality cannot be
used anymore. Same thing when you deactivate a key.

h2. Acceptance Criteria


Make the script element and features behave like the Database connect tool in
PowerSwitch 10 update1. Meaning that only when it is licensed (separately from
PowerSwitch), it can be used.
Make sure the property editor “Define script expression” is only available if
correctly licensed with a scripting module key.

h2. Notes


The SwitchProxy module is separate product and released with Switch 10 but from
Switch 11 on it will be “commercially” considered as a module.
No development effort required, just writing this story for completeness and to
make sure it gets tested by QA 

h2. Acceptance Criteria


SwitchProxy works fine with Switch 11

"#29"^"Client SDK module"^"h2. Narrative


As a  I can  to As a (prepress) manager on a tight budget I don’t want to pay twice for the
same features, so when I have purchased the Client SDK module I need the
SwitchClient module included. 

h2. Notes


The Client SDK is already a separate module (with its own license key) and
released with Switch 10 but from Switch 11 on it will be “commercially”
considered as a module.
Whoever buys this module is automatically entitled to use the SwitchClient
module. 

h2. Acceptance Criteria


Using only 1 key, the one for Client SDK, the same features and connection
rights as in the SwitchClient module become available.
Note that in such case the customer does not get separate keys for Client SDK
and SwitchClient module.

"#289"^"Tab based property pane"^"h2. Narrative


As a a flow designer I can get a clear overview all properties of a tool to get a better view of all functionality that tools offers and to set up the tool more easilyh2. Notes

:
1) Add tabs to the property pane.
In Scripter this could result in some kind of property grouping feature. If no groups are made, then tools looks like it used to look. If groups are defined, the group name is shown as tab title.

2) second attempt to clean up the property pane GUI. Where for Switch 10 we tried to get some kind of form layout in a table we could now use a real form. This would also not affect the preferences table GUI.

h2. Acceptance Criteria


property pane looks like image in attachment
