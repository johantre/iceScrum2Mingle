"#1110"|"SwitchClient module "|"h2. Narrative


As a  I can  to As a (prepress) manager on a tight budget I only want to pay for features I
actually use, i.e. SwitchClient, in order to get the most out of my investment.

h2. Notes



The communication elements (Submit point, Checkpoint and Checkpoint via mail)
should be licensed separately from Switch. Meaning that only when I use a valid
key, these elements become available in the Communication section of the
elements pane.
Next to the elements also the User panel and the Client Activity and Client
Connection pane on the Statistics panel should become available whenever
correctly licensed.
The key can either be a permanent or trial key. Both keys have the same result,
however a trial key is time bombed so when it expires, functionality cannot be
used anymore. Same thing when you deactivate a key.

h2. Acceptance Criteria



Make the Submit point, Checkpoint and Checkpoint via mail behave like the
Database connect tool in Switch 10 update1. Meaning that only when they are
licensed (separately from PowerSwitch), they can be used. Note that the
Database module only includes 1 tool and the Client module includes 3 elements.
Make sure the User panel appears according to the licensing status
Make sure the Client Activity and Client Connection pane on the Statistics
panel appear according to the licensing status.
Note that nothing changes to the “5 license included” policy for PowerSwitch so
if a customer has licensed the SwitchClient module then he or she still gets 5
licenses, knowing that this number of licenses can be expanded with additional
Client licensing.

As a  I can  to As a (prepress) manager on a tight budget I only want to pay for features I
actually use, i.e. Configurators, in order to get the most out of my
investment.

h2. Notes



The configurators should be licensed separately from Switch. Meaning that only
when I use a valid key, the configurators (i.e. elements in Configurator
section of the elements pane) become available.
The key can either be a permanent or trial key. Both keys have the same result,
however a trial key is time bombed so when it expires, functionality cannot be

SwitchScripter (Configurator SDK) always puts the configuration module ID in the scripted plug-in. Configurators created with older version of SDK don't have such ID. They should however also be loaded correctly in Switch 11. 
For our own tools we'll put the ID in the tool manually. SwitchScritper should not overwrite ID's that were added manually.

h2. Acceptance Criteria



Make the Configurators behave like the Database connect tool in Switch 10
update1. Meaning that only when they are licensed (separately from
PowerSwitch), they can be used. Note that the Database module only includes 1
tool and the Configurator module includes all elements from the Configurator
section in the elements pane.

"#1116"|"Switch (basic) version features"|"h2. Narrative


As a  I can  to As a (prepress) manager on a tight budget I only want to pay for features I
actually use, i.e. Switch most basic features (+- LightSwitch), in order to get the most out of my investment.h2. Notes



Enfocus PowerSwitch contains all LightSwitch functionality but includes the following changes:
•“Log job info” element is part of the Tools category in the elements pane (instead of the Metadata category. 
Note that all 3 possible schemes are supported, this is also the case for the Sort job tool 
•“XSLT transform” element is part of the Tools category in the elements pane (instead of the Metadata category.
•“Split PDF in pages” is renamed to “Split PDF” and is available in the basic version of Switch.
•“Merge PDF pages” is renamed to “Merge PDF” and is available in the basic version of Switch.

Note: advanced performance tuning features becomes part of Switch (basic)

Note that datasets are also supported in this basic version.
E.g. ftp send can create a dataset on the data+log outgoing connection (just like in LightSwitch). If customer has Configurator module then PitStop Server configurator can create dataset with a report and if the customer also has the SwitchClient module the he can see this report in SwitchClient.

Note that private data is also supported for some tools (e.g. group and ungroup) and that the job.PrivatData variable remains part of Switch (basic) (just like in LightSwitch) 

h2. Acceptance Criteria



The LightSwitch tools + those mentioned above are loaded correctly

As a  I can  to As a (prepress) manager on a tight budget I only want to pay for features I
actually use, i.e. Metadata tools and access to the metadata variables and
possibility to gather content for a SwitchClient dropdown list straight from an
XML based dataset, in order to get the most out of my investment.

h2. Notes



•The metadata elements (XML, JDF, XMP and opaque pickup, XMP inject, export
metadata)
•The metadata variables 
•And access to XML based datasets when defining dropdown list as metadata
fields on Submit and Checkpoints, 
Should be licensed separately from Switch. Meaning that only when I use a valid
key, those flow elements become available in the elements pane, the metadata
group becomes available in the variables panel (i.e. define single/ multi line
or condition with variables dialog) and  “Define values from dataset” becomes
available as data value for dropdown list.

The key can either be a permanent or trial key. Both keys have the same result,
however a trial key is time bombed so when it expires, functionality cannot be
used anymore. Same thing when you deactivate a key.

Note about datasets:

h2. Acceptance Criteria



Make those metadata elements and features behave like the Database connect tool
and the database variables in Switch 10 update1. Meaning that only when they
are licensed (separately from PowerSwitch), they appear in the metadata
category and so can be used.
Note that XSLT transform and log job info are not included in this module so
they do not appear/disappear based on license status of this module.

possibility to gather content for a SwitchClient dropdown list straight from a
database, in order to get the most out of my investment.

h2. Notes



•The Database connect element
•The database variables 
•And access to ODBC data sources when defining dropdown list as metadata fields
on Submit and Checkpoints 
Should be licensed separately from Switch. Meaning that only when I use a valid
key, this flow element and its new category title (Database) become available
in the elements pane, the database group becomes available in the variables
panel (i.e. define single/ multi line or condition with variables dialog) and
“Define values from ODBC data source” becomes available as data value for
dropdown list.

however a trial key is time bombed so when it expires, functionality cannot be

h2. Acceptance Criteria



This feature was already implemented in Switch 10 update 1. Only thing that
needs to be taken care of is that the Database connect elements appears in it’s
own category instead of being part of the metadata category.

Create a new installer for this new product.

h2. Acceptance Criteria



The installer is re-branded. (except for the artwork everything refers to 'Switch)
Old versions are *not* longer removed as it used to be (i.e. on win uninstall, on Mac clean up if we can find it)
So a user that has an old LightSwitch 10 and FullSwitch 10 actually ends up with 3 versions (LightSwitch 10, FullSwitch 10 and Switch 11)

"#1111"|"Scripting module"|"h2. Narrative


As a  I can  to As a (prepress) manager on a tight budget I only want to pay for features I
actually use, i.e. Scripting, in order to get the most out of my investment.

h2. Notes



The script element and property editor “Define script expression” should be
licensed separately from Switch. Meaning that only when I use a valid key, this
flow element and its category title (Scripting) become available in the
elements pane and the script expression property editor becomes available in
the properties pane.
The key can either be a permanent or trial key. Both keys have the same result,
however a trial key is time bombed so when it expires, functionality cannot be
used anymore. Same thing when you deactivate a key.

h2. Acceptance Criteria



Make the script element and features behave like the Database connect tool in
PowerSwitch 10 update1. Meaning that only when it is licensed (separately from
PowerSwitch), it can be used.
Make sure the property editor “Define script expression” is only available if
correctly licensed with a scripting module key.

h2. Notes



The SwitchProxy module is separate product and released with Switch 10 but from
Switch 11 on it will be “commercially” considered as a module.
No development effort required, just writing this story for completeness and to
make sure it gets tested by QA 

h2. Acceptance Criteria



SwitchProxy works fine with Switch 11

"#119"|"Client SDK module"|"h2. Narrative


As a  I can  to As a (prepress) manager on a tight budget I don’t want to pay twice for the
same features, so when I have purchased the Client SDK module I need the
SwitchClient module included. 

h2. Notes



The Client SDK is already a separate module (with its own license key) and
released with Switch 10 but from Switch 11 on it will be “commercially”
considered as a module.
Whoever buys this module is automatically entitled to use the SwitchClient
module. 

h2. Acceptance Criteria



Using only 1 key, the one for Client SDK, the same features and connection
rights as in the SwitchClient module become available.
Note that in such case the customer does not get separate keys for Client SDK
and SwitchClient module.

"#1120"|"DEV Info on missing elements"|"h2. Narrative


As a a Switch Administrator I can see to which module a tool, property editor or variable group belongs if i import a flow to know exactly what is missing and make it easy to extend Switch, buy or try  additional moduleh2. Notes


 / h2. Acceptance Criteria




When importing a flow with missing element a warning message appears mentioning 'Unsupported flow element xxx was detected when importing this flow” instead of 'Skipped unsupported flow element xxx”
Once imported and when hoovering over such element on the canvas the message still says: 'The flow element cannot be found by Switch.' (nevertheless it's a missing configurator or an unlicensed tool, we always give the same message.)

When importing a flow that uses script expression editor and scripting module is not active, the message says: 'Unsupported property editor 'define script expression' was detected when importing this flow'. 
Once imported, flow validation fails just like when importing such flow from PowerSwitch in LightSwitch

When importing a flow that uses a variable from a non supported group (i.e. metadata or database), the message says: 'Unsupported variable was detected when importing this flow'. 
Once imported, flow validation fails. Currently it is not clear to me what happens if you import such flow from PowerSwitch in LightSwitch so this behavior should be improved

h2. How to test



Create separate flows for each element to test flow validation and error message
Test on one version of Mac and windows

"#1161"|"QA Metadata module"|"h2. Narrative


As a  I can  to As a (prepress) manager on a tight budget I only want to pay for features I
actually use, i.e. Metadata tools and access to the metadata variables and
possibility to gather content for a SwitchClient dropdown list straight from an
XML based dataset, in order to get the most out of my investment.

h2. Notes



•The metadata elements (XML, JDF, XMP and opaque pickup, XMP inject, export
metadata)
•The metadata variables 
•And access to XML based datasets when defining dropdown list as metadata
fields on Submit and Checkpoints, 
Should be licensed separately from Switch. Meaning that only when I use a valid
key, those flow elements become available in the elements pane, the metadata
group becomes available in the variables panel (i.e. define single/ multi line
or condition with variables dialog) and  “Define values from dataset” becomes
available as data value for dropdown list.

The key can either be a permanent or trial key. Both keys have the same result,
however a trial key is time bombed so when it expires, functionality cannot be
used anymore. Same thing when you deactivate a key.

Note about datasets:

h2. Acceptance Criteria



Make those metadata elements and features behave like the Database connect tool
and the database variables in Switch 10 update1. Meaning that only when they
are licensed (separately from PowerSwitch), they appear in the metadata
category and so can be used.
Note that XSLT transform and log job info are not included in this module so
they do not appear/disappear based on license status of this module.

As a an operator I can easily upgrade my old Switch 09 or Switch 10 to Switch 11  to start production again right away with the new version, without having to worry  loosing data or settingsDEV 20 + QA 8h2. Notes


'*
Any Switch flavor should be easily upgraded to the new modular Switch.
Therefore we have a conditional license feature checking.
Note that we only need to support upgrade from 09 or 10.

h2. Acceptance Criteria



Upgrading is like it used to be (e.g. from 09 to 10) meaning all flows, preferences, settings are preserved and the old version is removed.

In case 2 switch flavors are found on the same system. The user will get notification and must decide which version he wishes to update at first start-up of Switch 11.

h2. How to test



* test upgrade from power, light, full for 09u3 and 10u2 to Switch 11 on one version of SnowLeopard/Leopard and windows XP/Vista
* power-&gt;Switch on windows 2008 Server R2, XP, SnowLeopard

"#1184"|"QA Info on missing elements"|"h2. Narrative


As a a Switch Administrator I can see to which module a tool, property editor or variable group belongs if i import a flow to know exactly what is missing and make it easy to extend Switch, buy or try  additional moduleh2. Notes


 / h2. Acceptance Criteria




When importing a flow with missing element a warning message appears mentioning 'Unsupported flow element xxx was detected when importing this flow” instead of 'Skipped unsupported flow element xxx”
Once imported and when hoovering over such element on the canvas the message still says: 'The flow element cannot be found by Switch.' (nevertheless it's a missing configurator or an unlicensed tool, we always give the same message.)

When importing a flow that uses script expression editor and scripting module is not active, the message says: 'Unsupported property editor 'define script expression' was detected when importing this flow'. 
Once imported, flow validation fails just like when importing such flow from PowerSwitch in LightSwitch

When importing a flow that uses a variable from a non supported group (i.e. metadata or database), the message says: 'Unsupported variable was detected when importing this flow'. 
Once imported, flow validation fails. Currently it is not clear to me what happens if you import such flow from PowerSwitch in LightSwitch so this behavior should be improved

h2. How to test



Create separate flows for each element to test flow validation and error message
Test on one version of Mac and windows

As a  I can  to As a (prepress) manager on a tight budget I only want to pay for features I
actually use, i.e. SwitchClient, in order to get the most out of my investment.

h2. Notes



The communication elements (Submit point, Checkpoint and Checkpoint via mail)
should be licensed separately from Switch. Meaning that only when I use a valid
key, these elements become available in the Communication section of the
elements pane.
Next to the elements also the User panel and the Client Activity and Client
Connection pane on the Statistics panel should become available whenever
correctly licensed.
The key can either be a permanent or trial key. Both keys have the same result,
however a trial key is time bombed so when it expires, functionality cannot be

h2. Acceptance Criteria



Make the Submit point, Checkpoint and Checkpoint via mail behave like the
Database connect tool in Switch 10 update1. Meaning that only when they are
licensed (separately from PowerSwitch), they can be used. Note that the
Database module only includes 1 tool and the Client module includes 3 elements.
Make sure the User panel appears according to the licensing status
Make sure the Client Activity and Client Connection pane on the Statistics
panel appear according to the licensing status.
Note that nothing changes to the “5 license included” policy for PowerSwitch so
if a customer has licensed the SwitchClient module then he or she still gets 5
licenses, knowing that this number of licenses can be expanded with additional
Client licensing.

"#1178"|"10u2 Shaker tests for FTP"|"h2. Narrative


As a  I can  to For the moment I am extending shaker to make it possible to run the same Shaker tests for different FTP servers without having to duplicate the tests/flows.

Because FTP is so important for update 2 I suggest that we also add an extra story for the next sprint to create the necessary feature and regression tests for FTP. This means making tests for all different properties of the FTP receive and send + extra tests for special cases like permissions or special file names.   
The tests can already be created for one FTP server. Once I am ready with my extension we can change the tests to run them for all available FTP servers that we have internally.

 Show tests that were created and that they run on the server that is setup in Minsk

Necessary to test each key separatly: test if features are locked/unlocked + test if functionality still works.
Necessary to test combinations: Test if features are locked/unlocked for combination from old Light, Full, PowerSwitch, PowerSwitch + DB
Test on one version on Mac and Windows
Shaker tests can be used to test functionality by using TestDrive as UI application by QA.

"#1164"|"QA Switch (basic) version features"|"h2. Narrative


As a  I can  to As a (prepress) manager on a tight budget I only want to pay for features I
actually use, i.e. Switch most basic features (+- LightSwitch), in order to get the most out of my investment.h2. Notes



Enfocus Switch contains all LightSwitch functionality but includes the following changes:
•“Log job info” element is part of the Tools category in the elements pane (instead of the Metadata category. 
Note that all 3 possible schemes are supported, this is also the case for the Sort job tool 
•“XSLT transform” element is part of the Tools category in the elements pane (instead of the Metadata category.
•“Split PDF in pages” is renamed to “Split PDF” and is available in the basic version of Switch.
•“Merge PDF pages” is renamed to “Merge PDF” and is available in the basic version of Switch.

Note: advanced performance tuning features becomes part of Switch (basic)

Note that datasets are also supported in this basic version.
E.g. ftp send can create a dataset on the data+log outgoing connection (just like in LightSwitch). If customer has Configurator module then PitStop Server configurator can create dataset with a report and if the customer also has the SwitchClient module the he can see this report in SwitchClient.

Note that private data is also supported for some tools (e.g. group and ungroup) and that the job.PrivatData variable remains part of Switch (basic) (just like in LightSwitch) 

h2. Acceptance Criteria



The LightSwitch tools + those mentioned above are loaded correctly

h2. How to test



Install Switch on one version of Mac and Windows. Check if necessary tools are available and other ones are blocked

"#1121"|"Module license expires"|"h2. Narrative


As a a Switch administrator / prepress manager I can not use features and tools that are not longer licensed to not break my license agreement20 DEV +1 QAh2. Notes



We need a mechanism to prevent Switch running with unlicensed features. 

h2. Acceptance Criteria



use case: database module trial expires.
1) before Switch service is restarted:
Flows can still be imported without missing element notification and flows can still be created because the database element is still in the elements pane. These flows can however not be validated anymore and the unlicensed tool gets the exclamation mark and message 'Invalid license'.

Flows that are running on the moment license expires keep running. There is however a daily check (every 24h). After this check -the flow keeps running but the unlicensed element or the element that uses some database variable (or in case of metadata module uses a script expression property editor) is market as a problem element. Jobs arriving at such element go to the problem jobs.-
*UPDATE: The flow does not keep running and we do not mark the element as a problem element. we just DEACTIVATE the whole flow. There should be a clear log message explaining which flow element is not functional anymore and which module is required to make it functional again* 

2) after the service is restarted:
The elements or features are not available in GUI anymore so customer cannot create flows with them anymore. When importing flows we indicate that features or elements are missing. 
Also existing flows will indicate missing elements. 
No flow can be activated anymore because validation will fail on missing features.

h2. How to test



Use time bombed key or trial key.

"#1189"|"Tab based property pane"|"h2. Narrative


As a a flow designer I can get a clear overview all properties of a tool to get a better view of all functionality that tools offers and to set up the tool more easilyh2. Notes



1) Add tabs to the property pane.
In Scripter this could result in some kind of property grouping feature. If no groups are made, then tools looks like it used to look. If groups are defined, the group name is shown as tab title.

2) second attempt to clean up the property pane GUI. Where for Switch 10 we tried to get some kind of form layout in a table we could now use a real form. This would also not affect the preferences table GUI.

h2. Acceptance Criteria

"#1170"|"QA Scripting module"|"h2. Narrative


As a  I can  to As a (prepress) manager on a tight budget I only want to pay for features I
actually use, i.e. Scripting, in order to get the most out of my investment.

h2. Notes



The script element and property editor “Define script expression” should be
licensed separately from Switch. Meaning that only when I use a valid key, this
flow element and its category title (Scripting) become available in the
elements pane and the script expression property editor becomes available in
the properties pane.
The key can either be a permanent or trial key. Both keys have the same result,
however a trial key is time bombed so when it expires, functionality cannot be
used anymore. Same thing when you deactivate a key.

h2. Acceptance Criteria



Make the script element and features behave like the Database connect tool in
PowerSwitch 10 update1. Meaning that only when it is licensed (separately from
PowerSwitch), it can be used.
Make sure the property editor “Define script expression” is only available if
correctly licensed with a scripting module key.

h2. How to test



Will be tested with correct keys for the scripting Module
Need to be check if the scripting features are enabled/disabled when key is (de)activated.
Test on Mac and Windows, one version

In an early phase of the installation procedure i get a warning that this version cannot be installed because the date of the build i like to install is older than the end date of my maintenance contract. e.g. 'No valid maintenance key was found on your system. After installation you will not be able to use this version until a valid maintenance key was activated.'
DVW: After the user gets the warning he has the choice to continue the installation or not. If he has a valid maintenance key he can activate it after the installation. This story is only about Switch 11, we need to create a different story for Switch Proxy.

h2. How to test



* Test on Mac and windows. Test on one version of Mac. Test on different versions of windows because of problems with manifests for example. 
* Test clean install
* Test with Switch 11 key with expired end date
* Test with Switch 11 key with valid end date
* Test with Switch 11 key with expired end date + Switch 11 maintenance key with expired end date
* Test with Switch 11 key with expired end date + Switch 11 maintenance key valid end date
* Test one of light, full, power 09 and 10 without maintenance
* Test one of light, full, power 09 and 10 with maintenance that has expired


==============================================================================================
For development:
We would only show a warning if there was already a valid Power/Light/Full/Switch key was found for which the maintenance is expired. Customers that never have installed a Switch before will not get this warning and won’t get confused.
We need to create a custom command line tool for Switch to check the license on the system to find out if we should give a warning or not. The command line tool can be built together with Switch and contain the same build number as Switch. This tool will have approximately the same license checking as we will have in Switch it self and can use his own build number to check the licensing.
It looks like we won’t need the help for the licensing team for this and that our team can implement everything them self.
The warning message can be shown by the installer and we probably don’t have to create our own UI. Using the installer UI prevents problems like focus problems or the problem that the warning panel is hidden behind the installer window like we had with PackManager in the past (but were solved in the mean time).

"#1141"|"Shaker tests for Configurators category"|"h2. Narrative


As a  I can  to Only write tests for configurators that Enfocus is responsible for, e.g. Adobe configurators, word, ...

Todo:
- reorganize existing tests according to new structure. In the story notes you can find a part of a mail that was sent begin september 2011.
- add new tests for elements, properties and values that were not tested yetTo have a more agile way of working we really need to get Shaker up and running again. Switch is a complex product with a lot of features. This makes it a lot of work to test everything manually and because of the complexity it is also easy for developers to introduce new bugs. Automated testing and test driven development is the only way to lower the number of new bugs and to ensure stable releases. I am convinced that these automated tests will be a big help for us during the refactoring and other work that we will do in the future.

 

Automated testing is only useful if the test run constantly and we make sure that the tests keep passing. I already setup a test machine in Ghent to continuously run Shaker tests. The tests are performed on a virtual machine that is reset every time to a clean state. For now we only test on windows and we only:
- run tests from 'Shaker Tests/NoSetupRequired/FeatureTests' on the Switch 10.x continuous and nightly builds.
- run tests from 'Shaker Tests/NoSetupRequired/RegressionTests' on the Switch 10.x nightly builds during the night

 The coming weeks I will setup test machines on Mac and also run the other Shaker tests.

Currently we are moving to a new structure for our Shaker tests. There are five main categories of tests:
1. Processing: tests for configurators which require the installation of the 3rd party application for that configurator.
2. SetupRequired: Tests without any configurators that require changes to the system before they can be used. E.g. mapping network drives, installing ODBC drivers or changing host files to map the name of ftp servers to the right IP address. We should try to have as much tests as possible that don't require any setup but for some tests this might not be possible.
3. NoSetupRequired: tests that should always pass on any system without having to setup something first. The idea is that every developer should be able to run these tests on his own machine in case he changed something. The test should only fail if something got broken and not because you first have to setup something.
4. RelationshipTests: contain published flows, e.g. sample flows that are included with Switch
5. Stress tests: for testing the behavior of Switch under heavy load

The Processing, SetupRequired and NoSetupRequired tests are split up in FeatureTests and RegressionTests. The ultimate goal of the FeatureTests is to have full coverage on the functionality in Switch. The ultimate goal of the RegressionTests is to have a test for each bug that was logged in BugZilla.

We will move to a new structure for the feature tests: The folder structure should first mention the category that the element belongs to in the Switch UI, then the name of the element, then the name of the property. E.g. Shaker Tests/NoSetupRequired/FeatureTests/Elements/Basics/Connection/IncludeTheseFolders for the 'Include these folders' property of the Connection element. This test should test all possible values for the 'Include these files' property: All files, All Other files, .... 

In some cases it might be handy to make a separate test for each possible value of a property, but in most cases we can limit the number of shaker tests by creating one test for all possible values of each property. Please also try to avoid using spaces in folder and filenames as much as possible.

For the moment we are far behind on the number of tests for our test driven development, it is difficult to see what is already tested and some test are failing. Therefore I would like everyone to: 
- Fix all existing tests that are currently failing. From now on you will all get mails the moment that the tests start failing.
- Add a test for each property of each element according to the new folder structure for our test files. If you want to reuse existing tests, you can rename/move them according to the new folder structure by doing a rename/move operation in p4v. 

From then on we will make sure that all tests keep passing and require that new Shaker test are written for every new feature (where possible). I already want to thank you for the effort and I am sure it will be a great help in the future.

"#1127"|"Start Switch trial and start module trial"|"h2. Narrative


As a a Switch administrator I can not activate a module trial as long as Switch is not licensed (trial or permanent) to 1) keep an overview on the basic feature set and the modular feature set and not get overloaded with all features right from the start 
2) not loose module trial time because i cannot use the features because Switch is not licensedDEV 5 + QA  2h2. Notes



It is not possible to license the trial of a module if Switch (basic) itself is not licensed (either trial or permanent)
This automatically means that if Switch is launched for the first time and the license panel is brought up, i will be able to activate Switch trial (and no other module as trial buttons will be grayed out!) or to enter a license file (which can include keys for Switch and modules).
If i choose for trial, then the activation procedure is started to activate Switch build in trial key. After activation i don't need to restart.

Since Switch is licensed now (either trial or permanent), it is possible to start the trial (because the buttons become active now) of one or multiple modules but i need to go to the license panel manually.

h2. Acceptance Criteria



Module trial buttons are grayed out if Switch itself is not in trial or permanent license state.

"#1139"|"Show passed and failed Shaker tests with cruisecontrol"|"h2. Narrative


As a  I can  to As a Switch developer or QA tester I want to easily see which Shaker tests passed and failed so I know that all tests are still running every day without having to dig into the log file every time.Cruisecontrol has support to show test results by mail and on the dashboard. See http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/main/configxml.html#merge

- Currently we only see the failing tests in the mails sent by cruisecontrol but it should also show which tests passed.
- Also the “test” tab on the cruisecontrol dashboard page shows “Test Suites (0)” for the moment.

This can probably be solved by making the format of the Shaker log files compatible with the junit format from Ant which is in xml. More info on the format can be found on http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/ant-dev/200902.mbox/%3Cdffc72020902241548l4316d645w2e98caf5f0aac770@mail.gmail.com%3E

"#11111"|"userfriendly defining dependency"|"h2. Narrative


As a a flow desigener I can more easily define dependent metadata fields for SwitchClient to make flows faster as behavior is more straight forwardh2. Notes



When defining dependency in metadata fields user get confused how to define the 'show if parent equals' field.
We already have a mechanism where the property editor fore the default value gets automatically adjusted to the type of the field. a same mechanism where the 'show if parent equals' property editor is automatically. adjusted to the type of the parent field would be most convenient.

e.g. parent: No-yes list type, then the dependent field 'show if parent equals' field should also be a No-yes list.

Next to the automatically adjusted type, it would also be nice to have more property editors for this condition field (e.e.g single line text with var and script expression.

h2. Acceptance Criteria



The 'show if parent equals' fields of a dependent field behaves like the 'default value' field. Where the editor of 'default value' matches the type of it's own field type, the 'show if parent equals' editor matches the type of not it's own but it's parent field.

As a  I can  to As a Switch administrator I like to have an easy mechanism to license Switch
and one or multiple modules in order not to waste time and effort while
hassling with multiple keys.

h2. Notes



Use Esko’s licensing mechanism with licensing files (i.e. files that contain
key(s))
Check how files can be applied on the mechanism (drag and drop and/or browse to
a file). No need to reinvent the wheel so if only drag and drop or only browse
to works then that’s fine for me.

h2. Acceptance Criteria



Use such license file in an activation wizard that accepts them (either via a
drag and drop mechanism and/or via a browse to file feature). Use files
containing only 1 key and files containing multiple keys.

Also allow to still use the old keys from Switch 09 and 10

"#1173"|"QA Database module"|"h2. Narrative


As a  I can  to As a (prepress) manager on a tight budget I only want to pay for features I
actually use, i.e. Database tool, access to the database variables and
possibility to gather content for a SwitchClient dropdown list straight from a
database, in order to get the most out of my investment.

h2. Notes



•The Database connect element
•The database variables 
•And access to ODBC data sources when defining dropdown list as metadata fields
on Submit and Checkpoints 
Should be licensed separately from Switch. Meaning that only when I use a valid
key, this flow element and its new category title (Database) become available
in the elements pane, the database group becomes available in the variables
panel (i.e. define single/ multi line or condition with variables dialog) and
“Define values from ODBC data source” becomes available as data value for
dropdown list.

The key can either be a permanent or trial key. Both keys have the same result,
however a trial key is time bombed so when it expires, functionality cannot be
used anymore. Same thing when you deactivate a key.

h2. Acceptance Criteria



This feature was already implemented in Switch 10 update 1. Only thing that
needs to be taken care of is that the Database connect elements appears in it’s
own category instead of being part of the metadata category.

"#1194"|"Build Switch 11 on the new Build Machines"|"h2. Narrative


As a  I can  to DEV 2 + QA 5
To have the nightly builds on time for QA we first need to use the new FlexNet 11.10 for Switch 11.
Afterwards we need to stop building Switch Main on the buildmacpro and start building on the macbuild03 instead.
Notes for development:
try to build after switching and do one activation/deactivation on both mac and windows before submitting

h2. How to test



As we switch to a new version of FlexNet we might have to completely retest activation itself on different OS versions and platforms. It is not necessary to retest the whole modules mechanism by checking each individual place where a module is used. To be evaluated if QA needs the help of development to test this on different versions.

* have to test on both Windows and Mac: test on Lion and (Snow)Leopard + 2008 R2 and Windows 7.
* different kind of keys: NFR, Commercial, trial keys. Upgrade and Full keys. 
* activating/deactivating, online/offline.
* upgrade from one flavor of Switch 09 and Switch 10 to Switch 11 + clean install of Switch 11.

The new Switch 10 job info panel only shows the number of jobs waiting before a specific element but number of jobs is not always a good benchmark for spotting bottle necks. The total size of all jobs says more.

As a Enfocus sales administrator I can more easily make Additional Client license keys to have less hassle with those keys as they will behave like every other module keyh2. Notes



Additional Client licenses used to have their own keys (product keys) and for each amount of additional licenses we had a separate features in those keys.
To make things easier we would like to have module keys (instead of product keys) and make the number of connections variable.

So a user would start with 5 connections coming from the Client module and can later on add 3 connections and later on 11 connections and later on ... connections. For every additional number we will provide a key.

1) New GUI looks like ... (to be completed)
2) This panel is shown at start-up:

As a a prepress operator I can submit files straight from Acrobat (PitStop Pro) into Switch to streamline the production workflow and fasten up processing because i don't have to switch anymore from Acrobat to SwitchClient and vice versah2. Notes



PitStop Pro 11 will become a SwitchClient. *Acting like a regular Client*, a connection license will be taken. So not like PitStop Connect or instant PDF, those do not take a connection license
Next to making sure Switch can handle communication with this new client we also need to do some refactoring to make the Acrobat plug-in. There fore we'll need to:

Factor out connection pane (not dialog, just the pane, no business logic) to be reused in PitStop Preferences window

Factor out “Discover” functionality

Allow a PitStop Pro SwitchClient ID in Switch as a regular client connection

Factor out SwitchClient business logic to a shared layer

Factor out SwitchClient UI and business logic for “Submit File” and “Enter Metadata”

Factor out SwitchClient UI and business logic for “Submit to checkpoint”.  For the UI we only want to reuse the list of outgoing connections.

Factor out SwitchClient UI and business logic for creating Job filters

Factor out SwitchClient business logic for applying a filter on a list of Jobs

As a a SwitchClient user I can type text in a multi line editor to be able to insert multi line comments in a user friendly way. Like making it possible to overview the text i just enteredh2. Notes



Now it is very user unfriendly to type a more elaborate text in SwitchClient metadata entry. A larger entry box would be most convenient so user can have like a 'Comment' entry on the metadata form.

h2. Acceptance Criteria



The data type has one more editor, being multi line text (other properties for defining this field on the server side are the same as for single-line text). resulting in a multi line entry box on the SwitchClient side. 
Number of lines to be defined (must be user friendly and still look good in the form). i guess 5 to 6 lines by default should do and then add vertical scroll bars.

As a a Switch administrator I can run all FTP tasks in a separate process to have a more reliable Switch and better performing FTP traffich2. Notes



Artem: 'I think this is mentioned somewhere on wiki pages. Currently there is the FTP crashing issue which is very hard to reproduce and thus fix. Taras and QA spend a lot of their working time on it. Having FTPExecutors similar to ScriptExecutors would allow to substantially lower the severity of the problem. I remember we had blocker FTP crashing problem right before the Switch 10 release, so I predict that such difficult FTP issues may arise from time to time. Creating FTPExecutors may be quite a big piece of work, especially if to work on this keeping in mind other possible kinds of Executors (MailExecutor?) we may need in future. But the benefits could be valuable enough so it worth spending time on this.'

As a a flow designer I can only see the copy dialog when heavy file transfer is going on to not get confused by this dialog popping up when not really necessary.h2. Notes



Artem:'There is the copying dialog in Designer that appears in case copying takes more than couple seconds. The dialog looks quite advanced, but frankly speaking I don't think all these progresses are really useful. It is too overloaded and I think customers rarely see it because Designer is not usually used when flows are in production. The problem is that the dialog copies files by transferring file content and not by using platform copy methods. This gives problems like lost attributes, missing resource forks and Finder info, incorrect file modification and creation date. The dialog comes from old Qt solution that is not supported anymore. Fixing it looks complicated so I would suggest just drop it away and use some very simple copy dialog with indefinite progress bar. This way we could use the same copying as used in Server and this should gradually allow solving the problems.'

h2. Acceptance Criteria



Old dialog does not appear anymore. A new dialog (with indefinite progress bar) appears only when 'heavy file copying is going on. So it does not appear as quickly as the old dialog.

As a  I can  to SwitchClient should only show submit point if the user that has logged on with Client is entitled to submit files as set up in the Switch User panel.I noticed that it is possible to select a submit point with both the SDK php sample and regular SwitchClient 10u1, while the user has no access right for that specific submit point. This is very confusing for SwitchClient users as the file seems to be submitted successfully but ends up nowhere.

Next to this quite some customers complained that is possible to submit files to inactive flows. Here we need an extra property on a submitpoint where a flow designer can set if it is allowed to submit files if the flow is inactive. If not allowed, the submitpoint should not be offered in SwithcClient

As a a flow designer I can have to worry about double values in dropdown list if the list is populated with database content to get better behavior of the dropdown list in SwitchClienth2. Notes



Mostly people want to populate dropdown list with only unique values from a database. Therefore another checkbox in the sql dialog for variables is required.
The checkbox should be checked by default and mention something like 'Hide duplicate values'
This will result in a SELECT DISTINCT statement by default. By turning this of the statement becomes just SELECT again.

"#1163"|"QA Configurator module"|"h2. Narrative


As a  I can  to As a (prepress) manager on a tight budget I only want to pay for features I
actually use, i.e. Configurators, in order to get the most out of my
investment.

h2. Notes



The configurators should be licensed separately from Switch. Meaning that only
when I use a valid key, the configurators (i.e. elements in Configurator
section of the elements pane) become available.
The key can either be a permanent or trial key. Both keys have the same result,
however a trial key is time bombed so when it expires, functionality cannot be
used anymore. Same thing when you deactivate a key.

SwitchScripter (Configurator SDK) always puts the configuration module ID in the scripted plug-in. Configurators created with older version of SDK don't have such ID. They should however also be loaded correctly in Switch 11. 
For our own tools we'll put the ID in the tool manually. SwitchScritper should not overwrite ID's that were added manually.

h2. Acceptance Criteria



Make the Configurators behave like the Database connect tool in Switch 10
update1. Meaning that only when they are licensed (separately from
PowerSwitch), they can be used. Note that the Database module only includes 1
tool and the Configurator module includes all elements from the Configurator
section in the elements pane.

h2. How to test



Test on one version on Mac and Windows
Test if custom category still works
Sanity check for each configurator. Test only one version of the 3rd party application per platform

"#1180"|"Maintenance expires"|"h2. Narrative


As a a Switch administrator I can choose not to renew my maintenance contract to save some money (on the short term and loose productivity in the long term :-))DEV 3 + QA 1h2. Notes



From Switch 11 on we have a new maintenance policy that mainly comes down to: If you have a valid maintenance, then you can install any upgrade / update. If you don't have valid maintenance, you cannot install any upgrade / update anymore so you stay on a specific version forever.

We will add some warning in the Switch installer but a user might still install a version that is build after the contract expired. If a customer install such version, it can run in trial but after the trial expires Switch should not run anymore. Therefore we need a mechanism that checks the build date against the date in the maintenance feature of the key.
If build date is later then contract expiration date, then Switch behaves a being not licensed (e.g. cannot activate flows anymore, ...|)

h2. Acceptance Criteria



Create a mechanism that checks the build date against the date in the maintenance feature.
Version with build date later then date in key cannot be activated.
Also warn via log messages that maintenance is going to expire within 30 days. If maintenance expired, log a message at every start-up

Latest specification about the overall licensing mechanism can be found in S:\ENFOCUS-Team\Product-Management\Source Documents\11\SS - Switch (Server)\Switch Modules Licensingv4.doc. Chapter 6 explains the maintenance licensing mechanism

This story is only about Switch 11, we need to create a different story for Switch Proxy.

h2. How to test



* Test with maintenance key that has end date that has already past and an end date with a date in the future.
* Test if if with only activating an old full, light or power 09 or 10 key, Switch 11 doesn't work until a valid maintenance key was entered
* Test only one one version of Mac and one version of Windows.

"#1146"|"Tests for Process module Scripting API"|"h2. Narrative


As a  I can  to To make sure that everything works correctly we also need internal automated testing on the current scripting API. The ultimate goal is to have a test for each function in the scripting API.

For this story we need tests for Classes: Process (and static functions)
We will first have to think what's the best way to setup these tests.

"#1140"|"Shaker tests for Communication category"|"h2. Narrative


As a  I can  to Todo:
- organize existing tests according to new structure. In the story notes you can find a part of a mail that was sent begin september 2011.
- add new tests for elements, properties and values that were not tested yet
- setup tests for different kinds of servers, e.g. for FTP, SFTP and email. We have added extra options to Shaker so that the same test can be done on different servers without having to duplicate and adjust the test each time.To have a more agile way of working we really need to get Shaker up and running again. Switch is a complex product with a lot of features. This makes it a lot of work to test everything manually and because of the complexity it is also easy for developers to introduce new bugs. Automated testing and test driven development is the only way to lower the number of new bugs and to ensure stable releases. I am convinced that these automated tests will be a big help for us during the refactoring and other work that we will do in the future.

 

Automated testing is only useful if the test run constantly and we make sure that the tests keep passing. I already setup a test machine in Ghent to continuously run Shaker tests. The tests are performed on a virtual machine that is reset every time to a clean state. For now we only test on windows and we only:
- run tests from 'Shaker Tests/NoSetupRequired/FeatureTests' on the Switch 10.x continuous and nightly builds.
- run tests from 'Shaker Tests/NoSetupRequired/RegressionTests' on the Switch 10.x nightly builds during the night

 The coming weeks I will setup test machines on Mac and also run the other Shaker tests.

Currently we are moving to a new structure for our Shaker tests. There are five main categories of tests:
1. Processing: tests for configurators which require the installation of the 3rd party application for that configurator.
2. SetupRequired: Tests without any configurators that require changes to the system before they can be used. E.g. mapping network drives, installing ODBC drivers or changing host files to map the name of ftp servers to the right IP address. We should try to have as much tests as possible that don't require any setup but for some tests this might not be possible.
3. NoSetupRequired: tests that should always pass on any system without having to setup something first. The idea is that every developer should be able to run these tests on his own machine in case he changed something. The test should only fail if something got broken and not because you first have to setup something.
4. RelationshipTests: contain published flows, e.g. sample flows that are included with Switch
5. Stress tests: for testing the behavior of Switch under heavy load

The Processing, SetupRequired and NoSetupRequired tests are split up in FeatureTests and RegressionTests. The ultimate goal of the FeatureTests is to have full coverage on the functionality in Switch. The ultimate goal of the RegressionTests is to have a test for each bug that was logged in BugZilla.

We will move to a new structure for the feature tests: The folder structure should first mention the category that the element belongs to in the Switch UI, then the name of the element, then the name of the property. E.g. Shaker Tests/NoSetupRequired/FeatureTests/Elements/Basics/Connection/IncludeTheseFolders for the 'Include these folders' property of the Connection element. This test should test all possible values for the 'Include these files' property: All files, All Other files, .... 

In some cases it might be handy to make a separate test for each possible value of a property, but in most cases we can limit the number of shaker tests by creating one test for all possible values of each property. Please also try to avoid using spaces in folder and filenames as much as possible.

For the moment we are far behind on the number of tests for our test driven development, it is difficult to see what is already tested and some test are failing. Therefore I would like everyone to: 
- Fix all existing tests that are currently failing. From now on you will all get mails the moment that the tests start failing.
- Add a test for each property of each element according to the new folder structure for our test files. If you want to reuse existing tests, you can rename/move them according to the new folder structure by doing a rename/move operation in p4v. 

From then on we will make sure that all tests keep passing and require that new Shaker test are written for every new feature (where possible). I already want to thank you for the effort and I am sure it will be a great help in the future.
